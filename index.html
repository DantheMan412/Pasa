    Penguins first started space exploration in the mid 1700's while the rest of the world was in the midst of the industrial revolution.

Launching from Antartica allowed them to remain hhidden from much of the world up until the late 20th century.

America was the first country to discover them upon landing on the moon. The Americans picked the landing site based on images that appeared to be some type of structure. This turned out to be a primitvie lunar base the penguins had since abandened.

Now the penguins share their technology with humanity in exchange for helping to stabalize the climate. Penguins and humans now work together in the ISS and are in the early stages of a joint mission to Mars.
